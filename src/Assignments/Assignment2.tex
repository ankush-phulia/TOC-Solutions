    \section*{Problem 2} Design NFA for the following languages
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item The set of strings over ${a, b}$ that have the same value when multiplied from left to right as from left to right. The rules of multiplication are $a \times a = b$, $b \times b = a$, $a \times b = b$, $b \times a = b$. Note that $((a \times b) \times b) = a$ and $(a \times (b \times b)) = b$, i.e. it is not associative
        \item The set of strings of the form $\{xwx^R ~|~ x, w$ are strings over 0,1 of non-zero length\}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \textbf{Solution} : 
    
    
    \section*{Problem 3} Prove or disprove $(r+s)^* = r^* + s^*$, where $r$, $s$ and $t$ are regular expressions and $r=s$ implies $L(r)=L(s)$)
    
    \textbf{Solution} :
    
    Let $\Sigma = \{0, 1 \}$ and $r = 0^*$, $s = 1^*$
    
    Then, $(r + s)^* = \epsilon \cup \{ 0, 1 \} \cup \{ 0, 1 \}^2 \cup \dots$
    and, $r^* + s^* = \epsilon \cup \{ 0\} \cup \{ 0 \}^2 \cup \dots \cup \{ 1\} \cup \{ 1 \}^2 \cup \dots$
    
    Now, consider a string $01$.
    
    Clearly, $01 \in \{0, 1 \}^2 \Rightarrow 01 \in (r + s)^*$, but $01 \notin r^* + s^*$
 
    Hence, $(r+s)^* \neq  r^* + s^*$
    
    
    \section*{Problem 4} Which of the following are regular sets
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item $\{ 0^{2^n} |~ n \geq 1\}$
        \item $\{ xx^Rw |~ x, w \in (0 + 1)^+ \}$
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \textbf{Solution} : 

    (a) Let $L$ denote the set, then assuming that it is regular, let $n \geq 1$ denote the pumping lemma constant

    \quad Consider the string $0^{2^n} \in L = 0^{p}0^{q}0^{r}$ with $p + q + r \geq n$, $q \geq 1$ and $p + q \leq n$. 
    
    \quad Now, from pumping lemma, $\forall i \geq 0,0 ^{p}0^{iq}0^{r} \in L$, i.e. $p + iq + r = 2^m$, for some $m \geq 1$. 
    
    \quad Setting $i = 2$, gives $p + 2q + r = 2^m$, and since $p + q + r = 2^n \Rightarrow 2^n + q = 2^m$, i.e. $q$ is a power of 2. 
    
    \quad Specifically, since $n, m$ are integers and $q \geq 1, q = 2^n$.
    
    \quad But this means that $q > n$, since $n \geq 1$
    and so, $p + q > n$  - a contradiction. Thus the $L$ is not a regular set.
    
    (b) Let $L$ denote the set, then assuming that it is regular, let $n \geq 1$ denote the pumping lemma constant
    
    \quad Consider the string $0^n1.10^n.1 \in L = 0^{l}0^{m}0^{n - m - l}1.10^n.1, ~1 \leq m < n, ~0 < l < n$, with $x = 0^l, ~ y = 0^{m}$
    
    \quad Now, from pumping lemma, $\forall i \geq 0, ~xy^iz \in L$, as $|xy| \leq n$ and $y \geq 1$

     \quad Setting $i = 2$, gives $xy^2z = 0^{n + m}1.10^n.1 \in L$ 
     
     \quad But since $n + m > n$, so $xy^2z \notin L$ - a contradiction. Thus the $L$ is not a regular set.

    \section*{Problem 5} Is the set $\frac{1}{2}(L) = \{ x|~ \exists y$ such that $|x| = |y|, ~xy \in L \}$
    
    \textbf{Solution} : Since, $L$ is a regular language, so, let, $M = (Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be the DFA that accepts $L$.
    
    Let $L' = \frac{1}{2}L $. We will construct a DFA $M' = (Q',\Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ which accepts $L'$ and hence prove that it is a regular language.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Q' = Q \times 2^Q $
        \item Let $S\in2^Q$. Define 
         $prev(S)= \{q \in Q\ | \ \exists\ a \in \Sigma,\ q' \in S\ s.t.\ \delta(q,a) = q'\}$
        \item $\delta'((q,S), a) = (\delta(q,a),prev(S))$
        \item $q_0' = (q_0,F)$
        \item $F' = \{(q,S), q\in S\}$
    \end{itemize}
    
    $F_1 = prev(F)$ will give us all the states in $M$ from where we can reach a final state of $M$ on reading a string of length 1. Similarly, $F_n = prev(F_{n-1})$ will give us all the states in $M$ from where we can reach a final state of $M$ on reading a string of length n.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let, $xy \in L$ and $|x| = |y| = n$. $M$ reaches to a state $p$ after reading $x$ and from $p$ it reaches a final state $f$ on reading $y$. So, $p \in F_n$. And, on reading $x$, $M'$ will reach a state $(p, F_n)$. By definition of $F'$, it is a final state of $M'$. So, $xy$ will be accepted by $M'$.
        \item Now, let $x$ be accepted by $M'$ and $|x| = n$. So, let, $M'$ reaches a state $(p, P)$ where $p \in P$ on reading $x$. Also, $P = F_n$. So, there exists a string $y$, reading which we can reach from $p$ to a final state in $M$. So, $xy$ is accepted by $M$.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence, $L'$ is the language accepted by $M'$.
    

    Regarding the grading:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If you have simply specified the DFA with no explanation, you will get at most 5/10.
        \item You need to prove that any string in $\frac{L}{2}$ will be accepted by the DFA \textbf{AND} any string accepted by the DFA will be contained in $\frac{L}{2}$. 
    \end{itemize}
